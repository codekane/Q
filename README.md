# Q
The primary goal of this project is to add a functional YouTube Queue to the
Dankhouse room on Ezcapechat. To this end, I will be using the provided
javascript embed to avoid having to actually make any of the video-chatty bits,
and will thus be able to solely focus on the task at hand, and create something
functional, and user-ready, in a much shorter time span.
